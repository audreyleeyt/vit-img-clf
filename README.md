# Enhancing Image Classification Tasks via Vision Transformer
Bird classification plays a crucial role in various ecolog- ical and environmental studies. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation into developing a robust and efficient bird classification model, employing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures and the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. By incorporating methodologies such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and model fine-tuning, we construct a model with high accuracy and resilience to perturbations. Furthermore, we extend our exploration to model compression through distilled learning and model generalization via the creation of a fewshot learning scenario. The outcomes illuminate that both enhanced CNN architecture and the ViT model yield comparable performance, with different underlying architectures. Through integration of the cutting-edge techniques and utilization of CNNs and the ViT model, our study advances the fine-grained bird classification methodologies and carries practical implications for real-world bird classification applications.
